# In this task I learned about AI--Based-Recommendation-System. An AI-Based Recommendation System is a smart software solution that suggests products, content, or services to users based on their preferences, behavior, or past interactions. In this CodTech Internship Task 4 project, the goal is to build such a system using Java programming and the Apache Mahout machine learning library. The project involves building a recommendation engine that processes user ratings or behavior from a dataset (like ratings.csv) and recommends items accordingly. This task simulates real-world use cases such as movie recommendation systems like Netflix or e-commerce platforms like Amazon suggesting products. The system is developed in Java, making it beginner-friendly and flexible for future upgrades. Apache Mahout, a powerful machine learning library, helps in implementing collaborative filtering techniques used for generating recommendations. The system uses a technique called Collaborative Filtering, specifically User-Based Collaborative Filtering, where the algorithm finds users who have similar preferences and recommends items liked by similar users.This AI-Based Recommendation System project teaches how AI and machine learning concepts like collaborative filtering work in the real world. It introduces beginners to Java, Maven, and Apache Mahout, giving a strong foundation for further AI/ML projects. This project is practical, simple, and showcases how AI can personalize user experiences in apps and platforms today. and finally, This task is very useful for me.
